Your event is now ready. Click publish and view it on the frontend.

=====Frontend Experience=====

Your visitors can find your fundraisers in the normal product listings. When viewing a fundraiser, they can see useful statistics about the event; Total Donations, Total Raised, and Days remaining.

The fundraiser will add a tab called Rewards (if applicable). Here the visitor can select their reward, and be given an indicative donation amount. Clicking a reward here will bring up the same modal that clicking the Donate button will. The visitor can choose or change their reward here, too.

Once the visitor has entered their donation and chosen a reward, they can click donate and the product will be added to their cart, ready for checking out.

=====Donations Overview=====

As an admin, you have the ability to view all donations from your visitors.

1.  Navigate to WooCommerce > Donations.
2.  Here you will see a list of all your fundraiser products, displaying the Total Raised and status.
3.  By clicking the fundraiser title, you will be able to see a list of all the donations for that product. That page offers a link to the order, the Donation Amount, the Reward ID, and the Order Status. This page will help you to see which rewards need to be shipped.

=====Templates=====

The Fundraisers plugin uses templates which can be overridden in your own theme. Simply navigate to the templates folder in the plugin, and copy them over to a folder named woocommerce in your theme.

I’d recommend avoiding overriding these templates as much as possible, as future updates may offer new versions of the templates.

More information on overriding templates can be seen here.

Fundraisers will work with any well developed WooCommerce theme. If you have any issues, just let me know.
