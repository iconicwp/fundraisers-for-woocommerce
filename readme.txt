This plugin allows you to create fundraiser style products in your WooCommerce store with target goals and dates. Useful stats are shown on the product page, and your customers can even choose rewards based on their donation amount.

WooCommerce Fundraisers was created to integrate seamlessly into WooCommerce. Each fundraiser you create is a WooCommerce product, configured in the same way you’d configure a simple or variable product.

Now you can easily take donations for your next invention, a charity event, or your upcoming wedding; whatever you’re reason, creating a fundraiser couldn’t be more simple.

WooCommerce Fundraisers makes it easy to set your target goals. Choose between an amount you need to raise, a deadline date, both, or a campaign that never ends.

You can offer any number of rewards for each fundraiser you create; set a minimum donation amount, description, limit, and estimated delivery date, where applicable.

As an admin, you can view all donations for a specific fundraiser on a single page, making it easy to ship out your rewards on time.
